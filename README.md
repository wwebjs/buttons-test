# ButtonsTest
A series of tests to collectively determine the specifics of buttons rendering on all platforms.

## Installation
Simply Click on ```<> Code``` and copy the command to clone the repository according to your choice. 
Then, just run the following commands:
```sh
npm install # Or you can use yarn install
```
then
```
npm run button-test # Or you can use yarn button-test
```

## Usage
Once the script is ready, it will listen for a text message called "buttons-test". This keyword will run the test. Simply select the platform you are testing on and it will try sending messages according to that. 

After that, please send me a screenshot of the chat (PLEASE BLUR ALL SENSITIVE AND PERSONAL INFORMATION) on Discord (purpshell#7620) (send a friend request/ Message Request) and this will help me so much in verfiying the function of my code.
